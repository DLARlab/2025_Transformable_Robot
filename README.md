# Transformable Modular Robots: A CPG-Based Approach to Independent and Collective Locomotion

## Overview

This repository showcase the design of a modularized robot, which can be deployed with different number of modules and configurations. 
Specially, both simulation and hardware control code are presented for the configuration of: (1) Single module (2) Dual-modules snake/biped (3) Four-modules quadruped.

Contents:
* **Designs:** Hardware design .stl and kinemetic illustration
* **MujocoSimulation:** Simulation in Mujoco
* **HardwareControlESP32:** Hardware communication and control
